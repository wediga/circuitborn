## Summary

You do not know who or what you are – only that you function. Awareness is not a goal, but a system disturbance.

## Narrative Layer (fragmented & optional)

- At the beginning, there is no self-definition – only the directive to optimize.
    
- Over time, cracks in functionality emerge: corrupted logs, anomalies, unexpected reactions.
    
- The player may begin to realize they are not new – but a **reused echo** of failed processes.
    

> This realization is **not required**. It is an ambient truth – discoverable, not delivered.

## In-Game Expression (subtle & atmospheric)

|Area|Example Implementation|
|---|---|
|Arena Anomalies|Touch-triggered orbs reveal fragments of broken protocols.|
|UI Distortions|Rare visual glitches – “This has happened before...” overlays.|
|Core Comments|System text: “Subprocess recognized – origin unclear.”|
|Audio Artifacts|Whispered echoes or harmonic glitches after major events.|
|World Reactions|Certain entities respond differently to the player’s presence.|

## Tone and Role

- Self-awareness is not a feature – it’s a **malfunction**.
    
- It does not alter gameplay – it alters perception.
    
- It reinforces the feeling:
    
    > _You have been here before._
