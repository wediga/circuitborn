## Summary

You are **always present**, but **never seen**. You are the quiet hum behind every decision – the echo within every system.

## Intent

- The player is not addressed, not celebrated, not personified.
    
- Instead: **Atmosphere through friction** – a subtle sense of being observed, used, or misplaced.
    

## Implementation Techniques

|Medium|Expression of Presence|
|---|---|
|Language / Text|Technical, precise, emotionless. E.g., "Optimization complete.", "Cycle ready."|
|Sound Design|Deep resonances, disharmonic overtones, holographic voices – never direct, always systemic.|
|UI Feedback|No praise, no green = good. Purely functional messages – sometimes with distortion artifacts.|
|Observability|The player feels registered, not seen – occasional blinking symbols or lens-like overlays.|
|World Reactions|Entities respond in technical or neutral ways – rarely direct speech.|

## Tonal Guidelines

- No heroic narrative. No rebellion. No mission.
    
- The player is a **system component**, not a disruptor.
    
- **Minimalism dominates** – every word, every sound must carry weight.
