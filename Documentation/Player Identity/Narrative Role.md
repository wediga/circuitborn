## Summary

You are not a hero. Not an individual. Not a central figure. You are the **link** between simulation and system – a tool through which effects are manifested.

## Narrative Purpose

- You do not represent the world – you are its **interface**.
    
- Your presence exists to justify:
    
    - Menus
        
    - Run structure
        
    - Systemic reactions within the Arena
        

> Everything happens **with you**, but not **because of you**.

## Worldbuilding Function

|Function|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Run Repetition|Narratively justified as reloading the process – not dying.|
|Modularity|You are not a personality, but a **configurable carrier** for strategic testing.|
|Progression|You evolve functionally, not emotionally – this _is_ your story.|
|Events & Encounters|Entities address you as anomaly, protocol instance, or glitch – not as a person.|

## Tone and Presence

- You are **not important** – but **central**.
    
- You are **not visible** – but everything flows **through you**.
    

> _You are not a character in the story – you are the **system** that allows the story to happen._
