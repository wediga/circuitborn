## Summary

Your evolution is not an adventure. It is a **protocol extension** – a structured record of your transformation.

## Functional Background

- In the world of _Circuitborn_, progression is not "leveling up" but a **state shift** in the subprocess.
    
- Your enhancements – new modules, Cores, system paths – result from successful **resonance iteration**.
    
- You do not grow stronger – you become more **precise**, **complex**, and **adapted**.
    

## In-Game Integration

|System|Explanation of Progression|
|---|---|
|Run Repetition|Each run is a new analysis cycle – not a restart, but a version update.|
|Core Leveling|Represents deeper synchronization between subprocess and origin Core.|
|Module Unlocks|Framed as decryption of legacy data fragments – not traditional rewards.|
|Ψ-Syntherion & Δ-Flux|Meta-resources as system distortions – not currencies.|
|Build Optimization|Grid choices are system interventions – not classic player actions.|

## Tone and Presence

- No cheering, no rewards. Only:
    
    > _“System status updated. Optimization continues.”_
    
- Progress is **not celebrated**, it is **logged**.
