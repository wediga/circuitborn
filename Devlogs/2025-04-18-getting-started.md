# Devlog – 2025-04-18: Getting started

This is not the beginning of the project.  
This is the beginning of talking about it.

I’ve been working on *Circuitborn – The Synthetic Arena* for a while now. Quietly. Privately. Carefully. I started with ideas, mechanics, principles. I built design pillars, laid out a world, structured everything in Obsidian folders and graphs. And for a long time, that felt productive – safe, even.

But eventually, I had to cross that line:  
**from thinking to building.**

And that’s when everything hit me.

I underestimated what it means to implement your own ideas.  
Especially when you’re learning the tools while building the thing you care about most.

Unreal Engine. C++. Architecture. Grid logic.  
I had experience in some areas, but not nearly enough in others – and as soon as I started prototyping, I ran into walls.  
Nothing worked like I imagined.  
What felt “clear” on paper turned out to be surprisingly complex in code.  
I expected friction. But I wasn’t ready for the emotional weight of it.

I had moments where I genuinely thought:  
> “Maybe I’m just not made for this.”

But I kept going.  
Not because of motivation. Not because of discipline.  
But because I want this game to exist — **because I want to play it.**

---

One of the hardest design decisions so far was embracing something I originally rejected completely:  
**randomness.**

Circuitborn is built around determinism. No hidden triggers. No dice rolls.  
But I realized that without *some* kind of uncertainty, tension gets lost.

And so, I created the Δ-Flux system — a late-game mechanic that introduces controlled chaos. It took me weeks to accept that this kind of instability had a place in my system. But now that it exists, I’m genuinely proud of how it works.

I let go of an absolute rule to make room for something better.

This project isn’t something I’m doing full-time. I’m currently in a vocational retraining program — learning Python as part of a broader qualification.  
And while that helps in some areas, *most of what I need for Circuitborn*, I have to teach myself.

That includes:
- Learning C++ to work properly with Unreal Engine 5.
- Understanding game architecture and component systems.
- Working with data structures and building systems that are both scalable and understandable.
- Structuring and maintaining documentation that actually helps me think.
- And honestly? Learning how to handle my own frustration.

There are weeks where I make great progress.  
And there are weeks where I feel like I’ve forgotten how to think.

Balancing this project with my retraining, everyday life, and the constant feeling of “I should be further by now” is one of the hardest parts.  
But somehow, *this still gives me energy*. Even when it’s exhausting.

Because this isn’t just a technical challenge.  
It’s a promise to myself.

Right now, I’m working through Harvard’s CS50 course on Python.

I don’t have a background in Python — my experience comes mostly from PHP and Java — but I wanted to really understand the language I’ll be using for AI-related systems later on. And this course gives me a clear, structured way to do that.

It’s not always easy to stay focused, especially with everything else going on.  
But I actually enjoy learning like this — building towards something that matters to me.  
Every small breakthrough feels like progress I can use directly in the project.

It’s slow at times. And some days are frustrating.  
But overall? I’m glad I’m doing this.  
Because with every new thing I learn, Circuitborn becomes more real.

---

There’s still a lot I don’t know.  
There’s even more I haven’t built yet.

But I’ve started documenting this process publicly — not because I have something to teach, but because I want to stay honest with myself. Maybe someone out there finds it interesting. Maybe not.

Either way: I’ve begun. Properly.

– W.
