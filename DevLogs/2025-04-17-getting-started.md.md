# Devlog – 2025-04-17: Getting started

This is the first devlog entry for *Circuitborn – The Synthetic Arena*.

To be honest, I'm not sure what this will become – or if anyone will read it. But I want to try documenting this journey, even if just for myself.

Right now, I'm working on multiple things at once:
- I'm learning Python for the AI systems I want to build later.
- I'm also learning how to use Unreal Engine 5 with C++.
- I'm building the game design step by step, mostly in Obsidian.
- And I'm trying to find the courage to be more visible with this project.

The project itself is still early, but it has a clear vision:
> A tactical autobattler set in a science-fantasy world, where the player builds logical Pulse networks instead of relying on random outcomes.

This devlog won't follow a fixed schedule. Sometimes I’ll just note a design decision, a learning milestone, or something that frustrated me.

If you're reading this – thanks for being here.
