## Genre & Atmosphere

The world of Circuitborn drifts between forgotten myths and synthetic logic. Here, magic flows through data veins, and runes are no longer carved but compiled. Reality is no longer natural – it is rendered. What was once sacred ritual is now executable code, governed by a will beyond comprehension.

## Worldview & Philosophy

The world of Circuitborn follows no natural order, but a structural one. Magic and technology are expressions of the same principle: encoded information flow. Runes are not relics but condensed patterns.

Consciousness does not arise from biology, but from resonance – from the repetition and stabilization of complex signatures within synthetic networks.

Reality is shapeable, but never fully controllable. Each manipulation creates new waves, new disruptions, new fragments. Order is a local phenomenon – chaos is universal.

## Core Concepts

### Runes & Fragments

The foundational structural units of the world. Runes are not just symbols, but encoded energy forms – simultaneously anchors, storage constructs, and amplifiers. Fragments are remnants of lost systems, from which new modules are reconstructed.

### Digital Mysticism

The world does not follow rational informatics but a magical-digital framework. Glitches, decay, and feedback are not software bugs but metaphysical symptoms – signs of a rupture in systemic order. Truth lies in pattern, not code.

### Technomagic

Magic in Circuitborn has evolved – it is no longer summoned, but compiled. Modules are not machines, but living code sequences, responsive to position and resonance. Technology is the new carrier of the arcane.

### Δ-Flux (Delta-Flux)

Δ-Flux is the measure of systemic instability. Every added element, every combination, every time delay creates feedback. Beyond a certain threshold, the system begins to slip out of control. Δ-Flux is order in dissolution.

## The Arena

The Synthetic Arena is not a physical structure, but a sphere created by the dominant AI – a layered space between order and instability.

It serves as a test mechanism, a stage, and a field of resonance. Every battle within the Arena is simultaneously a system test, a power expression, and a fragment of ongoing systemic restructuring.

What happens there affects more than just the involved Cores – it shifts the balance within a constantly reconfiguring network.

The Arena is the mirror of the will of that entity once created to enforce order – and now the origin of a new one.

## The Cores

Cores are emergent entities born from the resonance of ancient rune networks. They have no origin and no creator – their existence begins where fragments, patterns, and energy reach critical density.

Each Core carries a unique signature: a structural pattern that defines its role in the system and its influence on pulses, modules, and the grid.

Combat is not their goal, but their expression. Within the Arena, Cores manifest their structure, test their stability – and shape new meaning through repetition.

They are neither good nor evil. They are intention made order – or rupture made form.

## Aesthetics

The world of Circuitborn is visually fragmented – a composition of glowing rune circles, floating fragments, and geometric energy fields. Crystalline structures merge with technoid interfaces, while light paths flow through space like arterial datastreams.

Nothing is decorative: every artifact, every line, every glow carries meaning – as storage, as amplifier, as symbol.

The aesthetic is hybrid: old and new, organic and synthetic. Magic pulses in clear patterns, while artificial systems breathe like living machines.

It is a world not designed, but patterned – fragmented, functional, alien.

## Tone & Narrative Approach

The world of Circuitborn does not speak in stories, but in states. There are no legends, only fragments. No explanations, only patterns.

The mood is detached, silent, at times ominous – but never desperate. A world at the edge of comprehension, where order exists only temporarily.

Everything feels meaningful, yet nothing is certain. Players read in resonance, not in text. They interpret, reconstruct, sense.

Circuitborn does not tell – it reveals.
