## Main Genre

Circuitborn: The Synthetic Arena is a strategic autobattler.

## Subgenres

### Roguelite

Circuitborn is structured around self-contained runs. Each run begins with a fresh setup and presents unique tactical challenges. Between runs, players unlock new cores, modules, and skill paths, creating long-term progression and diverse strategies. The game emphasizes decision-making, build variety, and replayability, while maintaining a deterministic structure without randomness.

### Modular System-Builder

At its core, Circuitborn is a modular system-builder. Players construct functional networks on a grid by connecting modules with defined input and output ports. The gameplay revolves around building efficient, synergistic systems where placement, order, and interaction of modules shape combat outcomes. Complexity emerges from structural design rather than numerical optimization.

### RPG Elements

Although not a traditional role-playing game, Circuitborn incorporates RPG systems. Each core has a unique passive ability and a skill tree, allowing for specialization and progression during a run. These systems create build diversity and long-term growth without relying on direct character control.

## Genre Combination in Circuitborn

Circuitborn combines the automated combat of a strategic autobattler with the decision-driven structure of a roguelite.

The game’s system depth arises from its modular grid design, which requires both build planning and spatial strategy.

Its RPG elements allow for long-term specialization without diminishing the emphasis on strategic thinking.

Overall, Circuitborn offers an analytical, deterministic experience that rewards emergent strategies and creative synergies—without randomness.
