## 1. Artstyle Goal

A visually captivating style that merges the game's technical foundation with an organic, living aesthetic. The world appears as if the technology itself is alive – pulsing, breathing, almost mythical.

## 2. Technical vs. Aesthetic

- **Technical** in its systems: everything is based on modules, logic, and data.
    
- **Organic** in its appearance: flowing forms, luminous pulses, visual reactions resembling living systems.
    

## 3. Visual Inspirations

- **Noita** – high-res pixel art with complex effects and particle systems
    
- **Narita Boy** – techno-mysticism with glowing, inner structures
    
- **Hyper Light Drifter** – stylized world with a mystical atmosphere
    
- **Scorn** (as aesthetic inspiration) – biomechanical structures
    
- **The Matrix** – visual representation of living information flows
    

## 4. Design Principles

- High readability despite stylization
    
- Clearly color-coded effect types
    
- Movement and animation as expressions of "life"
    
- Avoid rigid geometry – favor flowing shapes and symbolic patterns
    
- Use shaders to emphasize vitality (glow, glitch, flicker)
    

## 5. In-Game Visual Elements

|Element|Visual Concept|
|---|---|
|**Pulse**|Luminous threads flowing like living energy through modules|
|**Modules**|Tech-frames with vibrating cores and symbolic ornamentation|
|**Connections**|Root-like, branching paths similar to neural networks|
|**Cores**|Floating energy centers pulsing like a living heart|
|**Effects**|Pixel explosions with afterglow and colored impact visuals|
|**Grid**|Semi-transparent, reacting dynamically to activity|

## 6. Suggested Color Palette

- **Neutral**: Dark bluish-gray for inactive zones
    
- **Active**: Neon cyan, magenta, yellow, green (color-coded by effect type)
    
- **Pulse Colors**: Defined per type/effect
    
- **Background**: Subtle animated patterns (e.g., data waves or light pulses)
    

## 7. Shader and Pixel Effects

- Soft glow and light trails
    
- Distortion effects for glitch interactions
    
- Breathing animations for Cores
    
- Static pixel noise during intense combat
    
- Wavy refractions for moving pulses
    

## 8. Pixel Resolution & Grid System

- Target resolution per grid tile: **32x32 or 64x64 px**
    
- Larger modules are built from multiple tiles
    
- All assets follow a strict grid structure
    

## 9. UI Style

- Also pixel-based, clean and functional
    
- Glowing outlines, minimalistic typography
    
- Hover glows and module descriptions rendered as tech-glyphs
    

## 10. Lore Connection

- The world is permeated by an ancient AI; technology has transformed itself
    
- Each module is a "cell" within a living network
    
- Pulses are not just energy – they represent thoughts, instincts, and signals
