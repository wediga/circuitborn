## Principle: Controlled, Voluntary Risk

RNG is not a core mechanic in _Circuitborn_. It is used solely to introduce emotional tension and build diversity **when players intentionally choose to engage with it**. All core systems (module network, combat logic, pulse routing) remain **deterministic**. RNG is optional, visible, and strategically manageable.

## Allowed Use Cases for RNG

|Area|Description|
|---|---|
|**Special Modules**|Certain modules may feature RNG-based effects (e.g. 50% chance to double an effect). These modules must be clearly labeled, show exact probabilities, and appear only in **higher rarities (C3–C5)**.|
|**Thematic Cores**|Specific Cores (e.g. "Unstable Core") may revolve around RNG as a central mechanic. They may grant bonuses to RNG modules or trigger bonus effects when RNG occurs.|
|**Special Encounters**|Some encounters may introduce temporary RNG rules (e.g. "Instability Field: All pulses gain ±10% random variance"). These encounters are clearly marked and strictly time-limited.|
|**Cosmetic Variance**|RNG may be used for purely visual or auditory variety, such as randomized pulse animations or sound effects. These elements have **no impact on gameplay or balance**.|

## Constraints and Limitations

|Rule|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**No global RNG effects**|There are no game-wide RNG mechanics in the core combat systems (e.g. no crit chance, no hit/miss rolls, no random pulse targets).|
|**No hidden probabilities**|All RNG effects must be **fully visible and explicitly stated**. No "secret rolls" behind the scenes.|
|**No RNG in starting builds**|Starter modules and starter Cores may not contain RNG. RNG is considered an advanced gameplay element.|
|**No RNG in metagame systems**|Meta systems like loot, Ψ-Syntherion, Core unlocks, and upgrades are **always deterministic**.|
|**No RNG-based victory conditions**|Combat outcomes must never depend on a single unpredictable RNG roll. Only pre-declared effects are permitted.|
|**Max 1 RNG aspect per module**|An RNG module may only feature **one random mechanic**. No nested or multi-layered RNG behaviors.|
