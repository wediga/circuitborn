> This document describes all mechanics that generate Δ-Flux during a battle. Δ-Flux is a dynamic, growing value influenced by actions in combat. The more complex or overloaded the system operates, the faster Δ-Flux increases. This system is fully deterministic and transparent.

## 1. Base Noise (System Tension)

Every battle begins with minimal Δ-Flux production.

|Condition|Δ-Flux|
|---|---|
|Every second of combat time (global)|+1 Δ-Flux|

---

## 2. Module-Based Generation (per Pulse)

Δ-Flux is generated by the actual movement and processing of pulses in the grid. The calculation is done per pulse and is fully traceable.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Action|Δ-Flux|
|Pulse is forwarded by a module|+1 Δ-Flux|
|Pulse is duplicated (Multicast, Split)|+2 Δ-Flux per additional pulse|
|Two pulses are combined (Fusion)|+2 Δ-Flux per fusion|
|Pulse passes through more than 5 modules|+1 Δ-Flux per module starting from the 6th|
|Pulse passes through a module multiple times (Loop)|+3 Δ-Flux per reuse per pulse|

---

## 3. Special States & Delays

These states occur dynamically during processing and generate additional Δ-Flux spikes.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Condition|Δ-Flux|
|Pulse stays in the grid longer than 3 seconds|+1 Δ-Flux per second beyond 3s|
|Module has < 0.5s processing time (Overload)|+1 Δ-Flux per pulse through this module|

## Design Principles

- Every player generates Δ-Flux – regardless of the build
    
- Complex grids generate more Δ-Flux – intentional risk
    
- Deterministic – no random effects
    
- Strategically controllable – high-skill players can develop builds to reduce or exploit Δ-Flux
