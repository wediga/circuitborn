## Purpose

The Aetherfract System is an atmospheric escalation mechanic in _Circuitborn – The Synthetic Arena_. It reflects the growing influence of the enemy AI during a Run, based on the player’s performance in PvP encounters. It does not act as a traditional health system, and it never removes control or fairness from the player.

---

## Core Concept

- Aetherfract represents a hidden destabilization of the Run's internal architecture.
    
- It is triggered exclusively through **PvP losses**.
    
- The system has no visual representation – players experience its effects only through atmospheric and systemic changes.
    
- A Run is terminated prematurely only if the Aetherfract value reaches a critical threshold.
    

---

## Drift Accumulation

- Each lost PvP match increases the **Aetherfract Level**.
    
- The amount of drift gained per loss depends on the current **Sector**:
    

|Sector Range|Drift Increase per PvP Loss|
|---|---|
|1–3|+1|
|4–6|+2|
|7–9|+3|
|10|+4|

- The final threshold (e.g. **15 Aetherfract**) causes an immediate Run termination.
    
- The Boss fight against the AI is only available if the player reaches the end of Sector 10 **without exceeding the Aetherfract limit**.

## Effects of Aetherfract (Atmospheric Only)

The player never loses control or mechanical access. Effects are purely stylistic, psychological, or narrative.

|Aetherfract Level|Atmospheric Effects|
|---|---|
|0–2|No visible change|
|3–4|Interface distortion: flickering text, minor audio glitches|
|5–6|Encounter labels become corrupted or renamed (e.g., "Shop" → "Node_34A")|
|7–8|Soundtrack shifts into dissonant patterns, Core begins emitting minor anomalies|
|9–10|Frequent visual anomalies, brief UI desync, distorted system messages|
|≥ 15|**Run termination**: AI seizes control before final Boss. Unique ending dialogue is triggered|

## Design Principles

- Aetherfract is not a punishment mechanic.
    
- It is not displayed numerically to the player.
    
- It cannot be manipulated or gamed strategically.
    
- It escalates tension and reinforces the narrative threat of the AI.
    
- It provides pressure and risk for PvP performance without invalidating player builds.

## Future Extensions (optional)

- Some Events may reduce or influence drift passively (e.g., hidden stabilization effects)
    
- Unique storylines may unlock based on high Aetherfract endings
    
- Cosmetic or lore-based feedback may be tied to how a player reached Run termination
