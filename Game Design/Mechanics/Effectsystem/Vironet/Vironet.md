## Purpose of the Effect

Vironet is a high-impact, escalating system-wide effect designed to punish high-frequency Pulse builds in Circuitborn – The Synthetic Arena. It spreads across the opponent’s module grid and causes direct Core damage each time a Pulse is processed through an infected module.

While Vironet is primarily positioned as a countermeasure against fast and recursive Pulse networks, it is intentionally designed to retain strategic relevance against slower builds through a gradual and fair decay mechanic. The effect has the potential to spread extensively but is entirely governed by deterministic system logic.

## Gameplay Identity

- **Role**: Countermeasure against high Pulse throughput
    
- **Nature**: Reactive, viral, deterministic
    
- **System Level**: Grid-level disruption, not unit targeting
    
- **Damage Target**: Always the enemy Core, not individual modules
    

## Thematic Interpretation

Vironet represents a runaway resonance, a cascading overload that seeps into connected subsystems and loops back into the source Core as systemic damage. It does not disable modules directly, but rather weaponizes the flow of data (Pulse) itself to strike at the structural heart of the enemy system.

- **Core Outputs & Ports** – Act as origin points for infection
    
- **Stack Counters** – Represent the build-up of viral charge
    
- **Timers** – Used for controlled decay in absence of activity
    

## Note on Terminology

The name "Vironet" is currently used as the official designation for this effect within the system. It may evolve during later stages of narrative and theming.
