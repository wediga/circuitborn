## Purpose

The meta progression system in _Circuitborn – The Synthetic Arena_ exists to provide long-term goals, a sense of advancement across multiple runs, and strategic incentives for players to experiment, improve, and return.

It should enhance gameplay depth without introducing imbalance or unfair advantages.

## Progression Types

### 1. Module Unlocks

- New modules are unlocked by reaching certain milestones within runs (e.g., reaching a specific Δ-Flux level, defeating a boss, completing specific grid setups).
    
- Once unlocked, the module is added to the pool and can appear in future runs.
    

### 2. Core Unlocks

- Cores are unlocked through major achievements (e.g., completing a run, using specific strategies, mastering a playstyle).
    
- Each new Core comes with a unique skilltree, pulse behavior, and combat effect.
    

### 3. Account Level

- Players gain experience (XP) after each run based on performance.
    
- Leveling up may grant cosmetic rewards or lore entries but no gameplay bonuses.
    
- The level system is linear and slow-paced to reflect long-term commitment.
    

### 4. Ranked System

- Players can optionally participate in ranked runs.
    
- A separate ranked score or ELO determines their standing.
    
- No gameplay effects, but visible ranks and possible leaderboard placement.

## Design Rules

1. No gameplay-altering perks or loadouts outside of runs
    
2. Unlocks always expand the available pool; they do not replace existing content
    
3. No randomness in meta unlocks – progress is deterministic
    
4. All progression is reachable through consistent play, without excessive grinding
    
5. Cosmetic progression is optional and never mandatory

## Open Ideas

### Core Path Unlocks

- Each Core may have multiple thematic skill paths.
    
- Only one path is initially available. Others unlock via long-term meta progression.
    
- Paths are still chosen and used **within** a run, maintaining fairness.
    

### Lore Archive

- Defeated bosses, discovered secrets, and special endings can unlock story entries.
    
- Purely cosmetic and narrative, stored in a player archive.
    

### Cosmetic Progression

- Visual themes for the grid, Core glow effects, module skins.
    
- Unlocked through account level or achievements.
    
- No impact on gameplay.
