## Purpose of the System

Cyberbytes are the primary in-run currency in _Circuitborn – The Synthetic Arena_. They enable players to purchase modules and consumable items, forming the central economic resource for build development and tactical decisions during a run.

## Core Principles

- **Temporary**: Cyberbytes exist solely within the boundaries of a single run. They are fully reset at the beginning of each new run.
    
- **Non-tradable**: Cyberbytes are a personal resource and cannot be shared with other players or entities.
    
- **Deterministic**: There are no random components in the acquisition of Cyberbytes – all sources are designed to be predictable and strategically planable.

## Balancing Philosophy

The Cyberbyte system is designed with a hybrid economy approach:

- In the early game, Cyberbytes provide access to core modules without overwhelming pressure.
    
- In the midgame, players are encouraged to make strategic decisions between saving and reinvesting.
    
- In the late game, Cyberbytes allow players to plug critical gaps in their builds without enabling full dominance.
    

## Additional Notes

- Cyberbytes are **non-refundable** – all spending decisions are final.
    
- Bulk purchases are allowed as long as the player has sufficient currency.
    
- Some encounters may offer **no Cyberbyte rewards** to create economic variety and tension.
