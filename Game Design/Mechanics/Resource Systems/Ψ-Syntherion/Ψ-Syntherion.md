## Purpose of the Resource

**Ψ-Syntherion** is a central strategic resource in _Circuitborn – The Synthetic Arena_.  
It symbolically represents the **mental and technological analysis of enemy systems** and is used exclusively outside of combat to **acquire loot in a targeted way**.

---

## Acquisition

Ψ-Syntherion is **earned exclusively by defeating PvE enemies** within a run.

### Calculation:

```
Ψ Yield = Base Value + Enemy Difficulty Value + Run Progress Bonus
```

Example values:

- **Base Value:** 3 Ψ
    
- **Enemy Difficulty:** scales based on e.g., module count, module level, or enemy type
    
- **Run Progress:** +1 Ψ progression bonus every 3 fights
    

→ Exact scaling will be handled in the balancing module.

---

## Usage

After each PvE battle, a **loot menu** opens showing all modules used by the enemy.

### Rules:

- **No RNG** – **all** modules used by the enemy are shown.
    
- Modules used multiple times are **displayed stacked** (e.g., "Ion Pulse ×2").
    
- The player can buy as many modules as they want, **as long as enough Ψ-Syntherion is available**.
    
- Loot that is not purchased is lost.
    
- **PvP battles do not generate a loot menu.**
    
- Every player who fights the same PvE enemy receives **identical loot options**.

## Cost Calculation

The Ψ cost of a module is **clearly and predictably** based on three factors:

1. **Rarity** (C1–C5)
    
2. **Size** (in slots)
    
3. **Upgrade level**
    

### Formula

```
Ψ Cost = Rarity Base + (Slot Cost × Slot Factor) + Upgrade Surcharge
```

---

### 1. Rarity Base

|Tier|Label|Base Value|
|---|---|---|
|C1|Very Common|2 Ψ|
|C2|Common|4 Ψ|
|C3|Uncommon|6 Ψ|
|C4|Rare|9 Ψ|
|C5|Legendary|13 Ψ|

---

### 2. Slot Cost

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Size|Type|Slot Count|
|Small|Intermediate Module|2 Slots|
|Medium|Intermediate Module|4 Slots|
|Large|End Module|6 Slots|

→ **Slot Factor: 1 Ψ per slot**

---

### 3. Upgrade Surcharge

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Level|Surcharge|
|I|+0 Ψ|
|II|+2 Ψ|
|III|+4 Ψ|

---

## Examples

### Module A:

- **Rarity:** C2
    
- **Size:** Small (2 Slots)
    
- **Level:** I
    

```
Cost = 4 + (2 × 1) + 0 = 6 Ψ
```

---

### Module B:

- **Rarity:** C4
    
- **Size:** Medium (4 Slots)
    
- **Level:** II
    

```
Cost = 9 + (4 × 1) + 2 = 15 Ψ
```

---

### Module C:

- **Rarity:** C5
    
- **Size:** Large (6 Slots)
    
- **Level:** III
    

```
Cost = 13 + (6 × 1) + 4 = 23 Ψ
```

---

## Specifics

- The resource Ψ-Syntherion is **non-regenerative** – it must be earned strategically and managed carefully.
    
- It represents **mental computing power, structural analysis, and enemy data understanding**.
    
- In the UI, the resource is shown as **Ψ** (e.g., “Cost: 5 Ψ”).

## Style and Identity

The term **Ψ-Syntherion** is inspired by:

- **Ψ (Psi):** Symbol of mental/analytical energy
    
- **Syntherion:** A coined word from _Synthesis_ and _Theoria_, representing strategic insight
    

It is deliberately designed to be mystic-technological and reflects the **science-fantasy setting** of the game.
