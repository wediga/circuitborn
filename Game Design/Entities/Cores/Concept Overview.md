## Purpose

The Core is the central element in _Circuitborn – The Synthetic Arena_. It serves as the origin point for all pulses and defines the strategic foundation of each build.

## Properties

### 1. Pulse Source

- The Core autonomously generates pulses.
    
- It has no input ports, only a defined number of output ports.
    
- Pulses are sent into the grid via these output ports.
    

### 2. Permanent Effect

- Each Core has a unique, permanently active passive effect.
    
- This effect remains active throughout the entire run.
    
- It applies strictly during combat and influences either the Core itself or the pulses it generates.
    

### 3. Skill Tree

- Each Core features a unique, linear skill tree composed of several themed paths.
    
- Skill trees differ completely between Cores.
    
- Players gain one skill point per Core level.
    
- The Core can be leveled up to level 20.
    
- Starting from level 21, all remaining skills are automatically unlocked. Any further level-ups only increase the Core's base health.
    

### 4. Passive Skills

- All skills in the Core's tree are passive.
    
- They may be situational or reactive but always function automatically.
    
- There are no cooldowns, active abilities, or resource costs associated with Core skills.
    

### 5. Output Ports and Pulse Frequency

- Each Core begins with a fixed number of output ports and a defined pulse frequency.
    
- Both values can be increased over the course of a run through predetermined progression mechanisms.
    

### 6. Combat-Only Scope

- All effects related to the Core, whether from its passive ability or skill tree, apply strictly to the combat phase.
    
- There are no Core effects that impact non-combat systems.
    

### 7. No Interaction with Meta Systems

- The Core has no interaction with the meta resources Ψ-Syntherion or Δ-Flux.
    
- These systems are unaffected by Core mechanics and are not influenced or consumed by them.
